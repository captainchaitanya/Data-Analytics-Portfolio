## 1. E-commerce Anomaly and Abuse Detection Engine

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://ecommerce-risk-analysis-dashboard-gskrtt464opqbpuhdbdeas.streamlit.app)

**Live Demo:** [**https://ecommerce-risk-analysis-dashboard-gskrtt464opqbpuhdbdeas.streamlit.app**](https://ecommerce-risk-analysis-dashboard-gskrtt464opqbpuhdbdeas.streamlit.app)

An interactive Streamlit dashboard for identifying and analyzing potentially fraudulent transactions in a large e-commerce dataset. This project was built as a portfolio piece to showcase skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and building user-friendly data applications.

üöÄ Key Features
Key Risk Indicators (KRI): At-a-glance metrics for total orders, high-risk orders, and total monetary value at risk.

High-Risk Investigation: A dedicated dropdown to immediately inspect transactions that cross a predefined risk threshold.

General Transaction Inspector: A tool in the sidebar to look up the risk profile of any order ID in the dataset.

Interactive Visualizations: Tabbed charts showing the Top 10 riskiest cities by average risk score and the overall distribution of risk scores across all transactions.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas, SQLite

Dashboarding: Streamlit

Data Visualization: Altair

Database Setup: Python's built-in os, sqlite3 libraries


## 2. üöÄ Proactive SME Cardholder Retention Engine
**‚û°Ô∏è Live Demo:** [**Click here to access the Streamlit Dashboard**](https://proactive-churn-retention-engine-bsbuhzwnddg3w9mlpt3cps.streamlit.app/)

## üéØ Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end analytical solution designed to proactively identify and mitigate churn among Small-to-Medium Enterprise (SME) cardholders. By leveraging machine learning, the engine predicts which customers are at high risk of inactivity and provides actionable insights and prioritized recommendations for retention teams. This project mirrors the core responsibilities of a data analyst in a marketing, investment, and analytics enablement team, focusing on turning data into tangible business impact.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Churn Prediction:** An XGBoost model trained on transactional data to predict the probability of a customer churning.
- **Precursor Engineering:** Development of key leading indicators of churn, including Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores and other behavioral metrics.
- **Insight Generation:** Use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain each prediction, highlighting the specific factors driving a customer's risk.
- **Prioritization Tiers:** Automated segmentation of at-risk customers into Tiers (High, Medium, Low) to help sales and marketing teams prioritize their efforts effectively.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** The dashboard provides customized treatment recommendations for each risk tier, bridging the gap between analysis and business action.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for real-time analysis and decision support.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Model Interpretability:** SHAP
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Plotting:** Plotly


Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Web App Framework: Streamlit

Version Control & Deployment: Git, GitHub, Streamlit Community Cloud

## 3. Loan Risk App 

My goal was to build a complete application from start to finish-taking a raw dataset, training a predictive model, and deploying it as a live, interactive tool that anyone could use.

You can test the live application yourself at the link below:

***Technology Stack***
Programming Language: Python

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn


## 4. Marketing ROAS Optimization Dashboard

This project analyzes marketing campaign performance to provide data-driven recommendations for budget allocation. The goal is to identify high-performing channels and advise on strategies to increase overall revenue.

**Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data simulation and Power BI for data modeling, analysis (DAX), and visualization.
